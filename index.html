      <h1>The OpenTF Manifesto</h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          Terraform was open sourced in 2014 under an MPL license, and over the next ~9 
          years, it built up a community that included thousands of users, contributors, 
          customers, certified practictioners, and vendors, and an ecosystem of open source 
          modules, plugins, libraries, and extensions. Then, on August 10th, 2023, with no 
          advance notice, and no chance for the community to have any input, HashiCorp 
          switched Terraform to a non open source BSL license. This change threatens the 
          entire Terraform community and ecosystem. 
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our concern: the BSL license is a poison pill for Terraform.
        </h2>

        <p>
          Overnight, tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from one-person shops
          to the Fortune 500, woke up to a new reality where the underpinnings of
          their infrastructure suddenly became a potential legal risk. The legal terms in
          the BSL license are vague, and now every company, every vendor, and every 
          developer who is using Terraform has to wonder whether what they are doing could
          be construed as competitive with HashiCorp. And even if you might be in the clear now,
          how can you build confidence that your usage won't violate the license terms in the future?
          What if your products or HashiCorp's products change? What if HashiCorp changes how
          they interpret competitive? What if they change the license again? As a result, everything
          that uses Terraform is on shaky ground.  
        </p>

        <p>
          It is clear that under the new license the thriving Terraform
          ecosystem will dwindle and wither. As developers consider what tools to learn, and what 
          ecosystems to contribute to, and as companies consider what tools to use to manage their
          infrastructure, more and more, they'll pick alternatives that are truly open source, without
          the licensing uncertainty. Existing Terraform codebases will turn into
          liabilities, independent tooling will all but disappear, and the Terraform community
          will fracture, and disappear. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This sort of change not only fractures the Terraform community, but it
          also harms all similar open source projects. Every company and every 
          developer now needs to think twice before adopting and investing in an open source
          project in case the creator suddenly decides to change the license. Imagine if
          the creators of Linux or Kubernetes suddenly switched to a non open source license that
          only permitted non-competitive usages. Would you still risk running your production software 
          using those tools?
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why the building blocks of the modern Internet, such as Linux and Kubernetes, are 
          handed over to impartial bodies (the Linux Foundaiton and the Cloud Native Computing 
          Foundation, respectively) who can ensure that those building blocks can form solid and 
          predictable underpinnings for our industry.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our goal: ensure Terraform is handed over to an open source foundation.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          In particular, we want to create a foundation for Terraform that is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            truly open source - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust, 
            that won't suddenly change in the future, and isn't subject to the whims of a single vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            community-driven - so that the project is governed by
            the community for the community, where pull requests are regularly
            reviewed and accepted on their merit
          </li>
          <li>
            impartial - so that useful features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the
            community, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            layered and modular - with a programmer-friendly project structure
            to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of
            tools and integrations
          </li>
          <li>
            backwards-compatible - so that the existing code can drive value for
            years to come
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our request of HashiCorp: donate Terraform to this foundation.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
          We ask HashiCorp to do the right thing by the community: instead of going forward with the BSL 
          license change, donate Terraform to this foundation, and keep it under a truly open source license.
          That way, instead of fracturing the community, we end up with a single, impartial, reliable home for 
          Terraform where the whole community can come together to keep building this amazing ecosystem.
        </p>        

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our fallback plan: fork Terraform.
        </p>

        <p>
          If HashiCorp is unwilling to donate Terraform to the foundation, then we propose to fork Terraform, and 
          to maintain the fork in the foundation. Supporting a fork will take time, skill, effort, and coordination. 
          To this end, this is a pledge to pool our resources and build a more open, more inclusive future for 
          Terraform.

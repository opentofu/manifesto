      <h1>The OpenTF Manifesto</h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          Terraform was open-sourced in 2014 under the Mozilla Public License (v 2.0) (the “MPL”).
          Over the next ~9 years, it built up a community that included thousands of users, contributors, customers,
          certified practitioners, vendors, and an ecosystem of open-source modules, plugins,
          libraries, and extensions.

          Then, on August 10th, 2023, with little or no advance notice or chance for much, if not all,
          of the community to have any input, HashiCorp switched the license for Terraform from the
          MPL to the Business Source License (v1.1) (the “BSL”), a non-open source license. In our
          opinion, this change threatens the entire community and ecosystem that’s built up around
          Terraform over the last 9 years.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our concern: the BSL license is a poison pill for Terraform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overnight, tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from one-person shops to the
          Fortune 500, woke up to a new reality where the underpinnings of their infrastructure
          suddenly became a potential legal risk. The BSL and the additional use grant written by
          the HashiCorp team are vague, and now every company, vendor, and developer using Terraform
          has to wonder whether what they are doing could be construed as competitive with HashiCorp’s
          offerings. The FAQ provides some solace for end-customers and systems integrators today,
          but even if you might be in the clear now, how can you build confidence that your usage
          won't violate the license terms in the future? What if your products or HashiCorp's products
          change? What if HashiCorp changes how they interpret competitive? What if they change the
          license again? As a result, everything that uses Terraform is on shaky ground.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is clear to us that under the new license, the thriving ecosystem built up around the
          open source Terraform will dwindle and wither. As developers consider what tools to learn
          and what ecosystems to contribute to, and as companies consider what tools to use to manage
          their infrastructure, more and more, they'll pick alternatives that are genuinely open-source.
          Existing Terraform codebases will turn into outdated liabilities, independent tooling will
          all but disappear, and the community will fracture and disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          This sort of change also harms all similar open-source projects. Every company and every
          developer now needs to think twice before adopting and investing in an open-source project
          in case the creator suddenly decides to change the license. Imagine if the creators of Linux
          or Kubernetes suddenly switched to a non-open-source license that only permitted
          non-competitive usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that the essential building blocks of the modern Internet, such as Linux, Kubernetes, 
          and Terraform need to be truly open source: that is the only way to ensure
          that we are building our industry on top of solid and predictable underpinnings.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our goal: ensure Terraform remains truly open source—always.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our aim with this manifesto is to return Terraform to a fully open source license. BSL 
          is <em>not</em> open source, so this would mean moving Terraform back to the MPL license, 
          or some other well-known, widely accepted open source license (e.g., Apache License 2.0). 
          Moreover, we want to be confident that Terraform will always remain open source, so you 
          don't have to worry about another sudden license change putting everything at risk. 
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our request to HashiCorp: switch Terraform back to an open source license.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ask HashiCorp to do the right thing by the community: instead of going forward with the
          BSL license change, switch Terraform back to a truly open source license, and commit to keeping
          it that way forever going forward. That way, instead of fracturing the community, we end up with 
          a single, impartial, reliable home for Terraform where the whole community can unite to keep 
          building this amazing ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our fallback plan: fork Terraform into a foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          If HashiCorp is unwilling to switch Terraform back to an open source license, we propose to fork
          the legacy MPL-licensed Terraform and maintain the fork in the foundation. This is similar to how 
          Linux and Kubernetes are managed by foundations (the Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native 
          Computing Foundation, respectively), which are run by multiple companies, ensuring the tool stays 
          truly open source and neutral, and not at the whim of any one company.
        </p>

        <p>
          In particular, we want to create a foundation for Terraform that is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Truly open source</span> - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust,
            that won't suddenly change in the future, and isn't subject to the whims of a single vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Community-driven</span> - so that the community governs the project for the community, where pull
            requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Impartial</span> - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the community,
            regardless of their impact on any particular vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Layered and modular</span> - with a programmer-friendly project structure
            to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of
            tools and integrations
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Backwards-compatible</span> - so that the existing code can drive value for years to come
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>LIST OF PLEDGING COMPANIES AND PLEDGED RESOURCES:</h2>

        <p>
          We acknowledge that maintaining an open source project such as Terraform takes a considerable investment 
          in terms of time, skill, effort, and coordination. We are grateful to HashiCorp for creating Terraform
          and their leadership in getting it to this point, and to the thousands of community members for their 
          contributions so far. The next step for Terraform must be to remain open source, either by HashiCorp 
          switching it back to a truly open source license or by us forking it into a foundation. Whichever way 
          it turns out, to ensure that there is sufficient investment to grow and evolve Terraform, the 
          signatories below pledge to pool our resources to build a more open, inclusive future 
          for an open source Terraform.
